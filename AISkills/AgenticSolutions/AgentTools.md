## [Integrate custom tools into your agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-agent-with-custom-tools/)

#### Custom tool options available in Azure AI Agent Service
- **Function calling**
    - Function calling allows you to describe the structure of custom functions to an agent and return the functions that need to be called along with their arguments.
    - The agent can dynamically identify appropriate functions based on their definitions.
    - This feature is useful for integrating custom logic and workflows, in a selection of programming languages, into your AI agents.
- **Azure Functions**
    - Azure Functions enable you to create intelligent, event-driven applications with minimal overhead.
    - They support triggers and bindings, which simplify how your AI Agents interact with external systems and services.
    - Triggers determine when a function executes, while bindings facilitate streamlined connections to input or output data sources.
- **OpenAPI specification tools**
    - These tools allow you to connect your Azure AI Agent to an external API using an OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
    - This provides standardized, automated, and scalable API integrations that enhance the capabilities of your agent.
    - OpenAPI specifications describe HTTP APIs, enabling people to understand how an API works, generate client code, create tests, and apply design standards.
