## [Agentic AI Engineering: The Blueprint for Production-Grade AI Agents](https://medium.com/generative-ai-revolution-ai-native-transformation/agentic-ai-engineering-the-blueprint-for-production-grade-ai-agents-20358468b0b1)

1. `Context Engineering` — Feeding the model the right information at the right time
1. `Workflow Engineering` — Structuring agent behavior into reliable multi-step processes
1. `Model Engineering` — Selecting or tuning the right models for each task
1. `AgenticOps` — Testing, monitoring, securing, and optimizing agents in production
1. `Agentic UX` — Designing interfaces that make AI actions transparent, controllable, and trusted

### Context Engineering
- `System Instructions`: What role is the agent playing? What goals or rules is it following?
- `User Input`: The immediate request or command
- `Short-Term Memory`: Recent steps, dialogue, or actions taken
- `Long-Term Memory`: Persisted facts, preferences, or prior outcomes
- `Retrieved Knowledge`: Relevant docs, data, or facts pulled from external sources
- `Tool Definitions & Outputs`: APIs, calculators, functions — and their most recent results

#### Techniques
- `Retrieval Augmentation (RAG)`: Use semantic search over vector DBs to pull the most relevant knowledge, not just keyword matches
- `Context Compression`: Summarize, chunk, or extract key facts to stay within token limits without losing meaning
- `Structured Templates`: Format inputs consistently (e.g., as JSON, tables, or schemas) to help the model parse them more reliably
- `Tool-Aware Prompts`: Teach the agent what tools it can use and how (e.g., “Use calculate_tax() if price > $100”)
- `Scratchpads`: Let agents write intermediate thoughts or plans that become context for the next step

### Workflow Engineering
- The discipline of structuring complex tasks into modular, multi-step processes, where each step has:
    - A clear objective
    - The right context
    - The right tools
    - And well-defined handoffs to the next step

### Model Engineering
- Choosing (and sometimes shaping) the right brain for every task your agent needs to perform.
- It's about balancing performance, cost, latency, and specialization — and doing so with precision.
- Models...
    - `Large general-purpose LLMs` like GPT-4 or Claude Opus — powerful for complex reasoning, synthesis, or long context
    - `Smaller, faster models` like GPT-3.5 or Mistral — great for lightweight logic, structured tasks, or short-turn latency
    - `Open-source models` like LLaMA or Gemma — ideal when privacy, customization, or cost control matters
    - `Multi-modal models` like Gemini or GPT-4o — essential for agents that need to see, read, listen, or generate across modalities (text, image, audio)

### AgenticOps
- AgenticOps is the emerging operational layer for agentic systems — think of it as MLOps meets DevOps, adapted for autonomous agents.
- It includes:
    - `Evaluation (evals)`: Measuring quality, behavior, and correctness
    - `Observability`: Logging every decision, tool call, and model response
    - `Guardrails`: Enforcing policy, compliance, and ethical boundaries
    - `Security`: Preventing injection attacks, abuse, or data leaks
    - `Optimization`: Improving latency, throughput, and cost at runtime
    - `Lifecycle Management`: Versioning, rollback, CI/CD, and agent drift monitoring

### Agentic UX
- The practice of designing how users perceive, control, collaborate with, and benefit from autonomous AI systems.
- Because no matter how smart your agent is under the hood, if users can’t understand what it’s doing, why it did it, or how to guide it — it’s just another black box with a blinking cursor.
