### [Create a Language Understanding solution with Azure AI Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/create-language-solution-azure-cognitive-services/)
#### Build an Azure AI Language understanding model
- `Utterances are the phrases that a user might enter when interacting with an application` that uses your Language Understanding model.
- An `intent` represents a task or action the user wants to perform, or more simply the `meaning of an utterance`.
- You create a model by defining intents and associating them with one or more utterances.
- `Entities` are used to `add specific context to intents`.

You can split entities into a few different component types:
1. `Learned entities` are the most flexible kind of entity, and should be used in most cases
1. `List entities` are useful when you need an entity with a specific set of possible values
1. `Prebuilt entities` are useful for common types such as numbers, datetimes, and names
