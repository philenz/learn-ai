## [Provision and manage Azure Cognitive Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/provision-manage-azure-cognitive-services/)

### Training and prediction resources
- While most Azure AI Services can be used through a single Azure resource, some offer (or require) separate resources for model `training` and `prediction`.
- This enables you to manage billing for training custom models separately from model consumption by applications,
- and in most cases enables you to use a dedicated service-specific resource to train a model,
- but a generic Azure AI Services resource to make the model available to applications for inferencing.
