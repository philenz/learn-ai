### Machine Learning
- `Machine learning` is a subset of data science that deals with the `training and validation of predictive models`.
- Typically, a data scientist prepares the data and then uses it to...
  - `train a model` based on an algorithm that...
  - exploits the `relationships between the features` in the data to `predict values for unknown labels`.

### Model training and inferencing
- Many AI systems rely on predictive models that must be trained using sample data.
- After the model has been trained, you can submit new data that includes known feature values and have the model predict the most likely label. Using the model to make predictions is referred to as `inferencing`.

### Azure ML Service features and capablilities
Feature|Capability
-|-
Automated machine learning| This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
Azure Machine Learning designer| A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
Data and compute management| Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale.
Pipelines| Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.

### Bot Service
- The Azure Bot Service is an Applied AI service for developing and delivering bot solutions that support conversational interactions across multiple `channels`, such as `web chat`, `email`, and `Microsoft Teams`.
- AI engineers can develop Bots by writing code, using the classes available in the `Bot Framework SDK`.
- Alternatively, you can use the `Bot Framework Composer` to develop complex bots using a visual design interface.

### Cognitive Search
- Azure Cognitive Search is an Applied AI Service that enables you to ingest and index data from various sources, and search the index to find, filter, and sort information extracted from the source data.
- In addition to basic text-based indexing, Azure Cognitive Search enables you to `define an enrichment pipeline` that uses `AI skills` to enhance the index with insights derived from the source data - for example, by using computer vision and natural language processing capabilities to generate descriptions of images, extract text from scanned documents, and determine key phrases in large documents that encapsulate their key points.
- Not only does this AI enrichment produce a more useful search experience, the insights extracted by your enrichment pipeline can be `persisted in a knowledge store` for further analysis or integration into a data pipeline for a business intelligence solution.
