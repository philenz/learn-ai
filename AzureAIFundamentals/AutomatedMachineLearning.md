## Use Automated Machine Learning in Azure Machine Learning
### [What is ML?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-nz/training/modules/use-automated-machine-learning/2-what-is-ml)
- There are two general approaches to machine learning...
    1. supervised
    1. unsupervised
#### Supervised
- The `supervised` machine learning approach requires you to `start with a dataset with known label values`. 
- Two types of supervised machine learning tasks...
    1. regression
    1. classification
##### Regression
- used to predict a continuous value; like a price, a sales total, or some other measure
##### Classification
- used to determine a class label
- an example of a binary class label is whether a patient has diabetes or not
- an example of multi-class labels is classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral

#### Unsupervised
- The unsupervised machine learning approach starts with a dataset without known label values
- One type of unsupervised machine learning task is clustering
##### Clustering
- used to determine labels by grouping similar information into label groups; like grouping measurements from birds into species
