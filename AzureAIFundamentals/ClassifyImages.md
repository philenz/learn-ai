## Classify images with the Custom Vision service
### Usage examples...
- `Product identification`: performing visual searches for specific products in online searches
- `Disaster investigation`: identifying key infrastructure for major disaster preparation efforts
- `Medical diagnosis`: evaluating images from X-ray or MRI devices could quickly classify specific issues

### Azure's Custom Vision service...
- Most modern image classification solutions are based on deep learning techniques that make use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to uncover patterns in the pixels that correspond to particular classes.
- Training an effective CNN is a complex task that requires considerable expertise in data science and machine learning.

- use the [Custom Vision portal](https://customvision.ai/?azure-portal=true)
- Select regions on images and tag them with labels
- Train a model to recognize the tags
- When training is complete, review the **Precision**, **Recall**, and **mAP** performance metrics - these measure the prediction goodness of the object detection model, and should all be reasonably high.
