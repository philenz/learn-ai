## Detect objects in images with the Custom Vision service
### Usage examples...
- `Checking for building safety`: Evaluating the safety of a building by analyzing footage of its interior for fire extinguishers or other emergency equipment.
- `Driving assistance`: Creating software for self-driving cars or vehicles with lane assist capabilities. The software can detect whether there is a car in another lane, and whether the driver's car is within its own lanes.
- `Detecting tumors`: Medical imaging such as an MRI or x-rays that can detect known objects for medical diagnosis.

### Object detection vs. image classification
- Image classification is a machine learning based form of computer vision in which a model is trained to categorize images based on the primary subject matter they contain.
- Object detection goes further than this to classify individual objects within the image, and to return the coordinates of a bounding box that indicates the object's location.
