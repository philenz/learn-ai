- Azure cognitive services that support translation
    - The **Translator** service, which supports text-to-text translation.
        - Uses a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model** for translation, which analyzes the semantic context of the text.
        - Supports more than 60 languages.
        - Optional profanity filering and selective translation.
    - The **Speech** service, which enables speech to text and speech-to-speech translation.
        - Includes the following application programming interfaces (APIs):
            - `Speech to text` - used to transcribe speech from an audio source to text format.
