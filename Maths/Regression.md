Regression is a statistical method used to determine the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. There are two main types of regression: simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.

Simple linear regression is used when there is only one independent variable, while multiple linear regression is used when there are two or more independent variables. In simple linear regression, a line is fitted to the data that best describes the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The line is represented by an equation of the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, while the y-intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is equal to zero.

Multiple linear regression is similar to simple linear regression, but it involves more than one independent variable. In this case, a plane or hyperplane is fitted to the data that best describes the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The equation for multiple linear regression takes the form y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bkxk, where b0 is the y-intercept and b1, b2, ..., bk are the slopes for each independent variable.

There are many resources available online to help you learn more about regression. Some good places to start include [Wikipedia](^1^), which provides an in-depth explanation of regression analysis, [Investopedia](^2^), which offers an easy-to-understand introduction to regression, and [EDUCBA](^3^), which has a complete guide on regression and its two types. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
