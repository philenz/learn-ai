    - [Agentic AI - What and How!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYJ539hgDS0)
        - This source explores the concept of **agentic AI**, defining it as an autonomous AI capable of **complex planning and execution** without constant human intervention, triggered by various events.
        - It contrasts agentic AI with basic AI agents, emphasizing its ability to **dynamically create solutions** rather than following predefined workflows.
        - The discussion then transitions into practical implementation, showcasing both **low-code solutions** like Co-pilot Studio, which enable generative orchestration and custom knowledge integration, and **pro-code solutions** using Semantic Kernel, highlighting its structure for multi-agent systems and collaboration.
        - The source concludes by stressing the importance of **governance, testing, and data security** when deploying these powerful, autonomous AI agents.
    - [Azure AI Foundry Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq8Cq7RZM2o)
        - The source provides an extensive overview of **Azure AI Foundry**, highlighting its role as a **comprehensive platform for professional-code AI development**.
        - It distinguishes between **Microsoft's pre-built Copilots**, user-created "little c" copilots using **Copilot Studio (low-code)**, and the advanced **pro-code capabilities of Azure AI Foundry**.
        - The discussion covers **model management**, including a vast catalog of models and tools for **evaluation and fine-tuning**, and emphasizes the importance of **content safety** and **developer tooling** such as agents and prompt flow.
        - Ultimately, the source positions **Azure AI Foundry** as the **centralized environment for integrating AI solutions** with existing enterprise infrastructure.
