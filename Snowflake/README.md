    - `Hands-on Essentials Track` - If you’re new to Snowflake or new to databases in general,
and you like hands-on labs and short videos, this is the track for you. Start with Badge 1:
Data Warehousing Workshop
    - `Level Up First Concepts Track` - Learn the basic Snowflake concepts- great for project
managers and/or managers who need a high level overview of Snowflake
    - `Level Up Snowpark Essentials` - Snowpark and Streamlit
    - `Data Cloud Deployment Framework` - In this course, you'll navigate through key aspects
of Snowflake's Data Cloud Deployment Framework, gaining valuable insights into its core
elements.
    - `Snowflake x GenAI: A Cool Collab` - In this highly-interactive hands-on mini-workshop (or
module) you will use an LLM API to generate original text responses. After getting
familiar with ChatGPT, and OpenAI Playground, you will move to Snowflake where you'll
set up a function that calls the OpenAI LLM API in order to return results directly in
Snowflake. Finally, learners will build a simple Streamlit in Snowflake GUI interface so
that users can interact with the GenAI LLM from within Snowflake.
    - `Snowflake x GenAI: LLM Functions` - Learners begin by exploring the TRANSLATE()
function with exercises that explore English to Japanese and back again to check
translation quality. Next, learners use the SENTIMENT() function and the SUMMARIZE()
function in simple exercises. After the high-level function introduction, learners build a
simple Machine Learning model that processes pdf files of popular songs like "99
Luftballons" and "Flashdance" (in English AND Swedish)! After training and testing their
model, the learner revisits the LLM functions and applies them to the lyrics they
extracted via the ML Model they created!
